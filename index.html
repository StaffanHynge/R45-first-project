                And the land is dark
                And the moon is the only light we'll see
                No, I won't be afraid, oh, I won't be afraid
                Just as long as you stand, stand by me
                So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me
                Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me
                If the sky that we look upon
                Should tumble and fall
                Or the mountains should crumble to the sea
                I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
                Just as long as you stand, stand by me</p>
